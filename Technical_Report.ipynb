Thus, in addition to star rating information, I would use sentiment scores per review.

Thus, if the first hypothesis fails, I would like to test the second hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "A research published by Harvard University indicates that positive reviews and a one-star increase contributed to a 5-9% increase in revenue of independent restaurants. Since each person defines star ratings differently, I used sentiment scores per review to identify positive/negative reviews in addition to star rating information. Therefore, sentiment scores obtained from reviews and star rating valuable could be valuable in predicting business success. \n",

    "\n",
    "**First Trial**: To generate text features, I grouped all reviews by “business_id” and concatenated same restaurant review into one field to create a column of average sentiment scores per restaurant. However, I failed to finish creating the set of reviews overnight due to the large size of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Trial**: I decided to reduce the size of the dataset and therefore improve compute times. Although I finished running the Logistic Regression models in a much shorter time, the list of coefficient values was not clear enough to obtain insights. The scores on the evaluation metrics were almost the same as the baseline. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Third Trial**: To improve the model performance and get better insights, I grouped the check-in and review information into different categories by using pandas.qcut: high, medium, and low. This was helpful to analyse if there are any specific factors that might be strongly correlated with business success. Additionally, I applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the dataset as it was an outlier free dataset and SVM usually works well in a low dimensional problem set. However, SVM (svm.SVC(C=1.0, kernel='poly', degree=3, gamma='scale', probability=True) consumed more computational power than other classification models thus I did not try parameter tuning in SVM and decided to try Random Forest.  \n",

It implies that star rating and sentiment did no help in predicting the success of the restaurant.

The reasons why I avoided using it are (1) PCA may not work so well if all the 200+ categorical variables are strongly non-linear and (2) Results are often difficult to interpret and not always the best for visualization. \n",

    "\n",
    "I started with a **Logistic Regression with a Ridge penalty** which included all of the features in the model and prevents overfitting. It returned higher scores on evaluation metrics than the baseline. However, the coefficient table showed that it posed computational challenges and did not get rid of irrelevant features. Then I used a **Logistic Regression with a Lasso penalty**. The model was suitable for this research question as it seeks to push the coefficients for many variables to zero. It also reduces model complexity, so that the model can become better at predicting and generalising. Additionally, I used **GridsearchCV on Logistic Regression** to make sure if there was a better parameter I could use to get better scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used a **Decision Tree Classifier** which also makes feature selection happen automatically and prevent unimportant features from influencing the result. It returned train accuracy of 96%, test accuracy of 69%, cross-validation score of 69%. Hence, when this classifier was run on unseen data, it did not find these patterns and returned predictions with more errors. To improve the model's performance, I also implemented **GridsearchCV on Decision Tree** to find the best parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also used a **K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier (KNN)** to see if returned higher accuracy scores. I thought it would be useful, because it was not easy to make assumptions about the 200+ categorical variables and, in the real world, most of the data does not obey the typical theoretical assumptions made. However, the testing phase of KNN was computationally expensive and it is considered sensitive to irrelevant features and the scale of data. It returned the second lowest cross-validation score. \n",
    "\n",
    "In effort to improve accuracy I used **ensemble learning algorithms**, which are built combining weak uncorrelated models increasing the weights/importance of misclassified observations on each iteration to obtain better predictions.  I started with an **Ada Boost Classifier** which is known to robust a strong classifier by ensuring the accurate predictions of unusual observations and minimizing training error. Followed by a **Gradient Boosting classifier** which differs by fitting the new predictor to the residual errors made by the previous predictor. In this situation, a bagging classifier like Random Forest would be inefficient with the number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I built a **Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier**, though I understand that SVM is not suitable for the classification of large datasets since the training complexity is significantly dependent on the dataset size. After tuning the gamma parameter several times, I found that SVM did not drastically improve the evaluation scores. Thus, I stopped modifying an algorithm here.  \n",

    "\n",
    "I generated **'checkin_count'** and **'review_count’** features to try to see if the popularity of the restaurant affects its future success. It turned out to be true: check-in and review counts are the most correlated to business success. Many business owners think Yelp as an advertising platform and customers believe it as a platform where they can check the business information as well as quality. Thus, it is easily expected that having more check-ins and reviews would be critical for business survival.\n",

    "Those who offer **fast food**, **take-out food**, **breakfast**, **sandwiches** and **pizza** tend to be successful. It might be because the profit margin is higher and human resource cost might be cheaper than other food types. Another remarkable feature is **parking availability** and **drive-thru**. Since car and mobility are essentially synonymous with modern American life, the availability of parking is essential. Similar reason to **fast food**, those offering **dinner** might have a higher survival rate since drinks and beverages have a higher profit margin. **Happy Hours** are a hugely successful sales and marketing strategy that has thrived for a long time. **Wifi** features seem interesting - I guess it is important to show WiFi availability on the internet.\n",

    "    - Chain restaurant: Some of the previous work identified that chain restaurants might have a more stable business style and more economic support, and thus better success rates. To obtain better insights, restaurants which appeared three times or more in the dataset could be classified as chain restaurants = 1 and others could be marked as 0.\n",
    "    - Estimated retention data by counting return guests\n",
    "- Improve the generation method of checkin_count and review_count features\n",
    "    - Some aspects might be overlooked when we generated checkin_count and review_count features: I did not normalize the review count by the number of days since the first review. For example, a 3- month-old restaurant having 1000 reviews is totally different from a 10-year-old restaurant having the same amount of reviews. As a result, the overlooking of normalization might be a potential area for improvement.\n",
    "- Analyze the information per state or city to see local trends\n",
    "    - It could be hypothesized that a higher retention rate could contribute to reducing the possibility of being closed down. The column could be obtained from check-in and review information per user - these contain business_ids too. For example, a return guest for a restaurant could be identified when s/he had two or more check-ins and/or reviews for a particular restaurant. I believe looking at the dataset from different angles would give further valuable insights for business owners and investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future research on reviews, one of the potential solutions could be to select words and reviews strictly and drop ambiguous words to obtain better insights on what customers care about when they write positive and negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in the scope of the capstone project’s time constraints, and because I decided to use classifiers that would compute on my local machine, a future consideration would be to deploy my model on AWS which would give me more computing power and better choice of models. "
